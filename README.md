# Web-Tech-Mini-Project

A Home Services Booking web application that will allow users to create and book home services like Plumbing, Carpentry, Cleaning, etc.
The app will host two different types of users - the seller who will create the services and the buyer who will book the services.
By default the app opens the Home page which displays all the available services. In order to post/book a service, the user will have to login. 
The register page will allow registering a new user, whose data will be saved in the database. Once registered, the user will be redirected to the Login page where the user can login. Once the user’s credentials are verified with the details stored in the database, the user will be redirected to the Dashboard page.
The Dashboard page contains the user’s details, his Bookings (services which he has booked) and his Services (which he has created). The user will now have the option to add a new service, which will be stored in the database and displayed in the Home page. The user will also have the option to browse all the services available and choose any service to book.
